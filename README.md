# IJC437-Project-Predicting-Song-Popularity-Using-Metadata-and-Acoustic-Features-on-Modern-Music
This study analysed the MusicOSet and looked at 5,791 songs from the years 2000 - 2018 to predict song popularity using acoustic and metadata features. The models revealed that valence, duration, energy, and artist type were the primary predictors of song popularity. However, the low AUCs and R2s indicated more significant external variables.
